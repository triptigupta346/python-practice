# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]
